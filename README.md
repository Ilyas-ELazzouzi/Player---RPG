# Player---RPG

I created an interactive text-based RPG in Python, where players embark on a heroic journey through the Forgotten Lands. The game features:

- Character Classes: Developed a Player and Enemy class with unique attributes such as health, attack, and defense.
- Combat System: Players engage in turn-based battles, making strategic choices to attack, use items, or flee.
- Leveling and Inventory: Players gain experience, level up, and use items like Crimson Revival potions and Attack Swords to enhance their abilities.
- Randomized Encounters: The world is filled with random encounters and battles against different types of enemies with unique stories and strengths.
- Exploration and Progression: Players explore, collect items, and strengthen their character to eventually face the Master of Darkness.

The game is built using Object-Oriented Programming principles in Python, showcasing class design, managing game flow, and implementing strategic gameplay.
